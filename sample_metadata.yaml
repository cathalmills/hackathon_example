methods: >
  A mechanistic SEIR model fitted to daily case and death data using
  Bayesian inference.
data_inputs: >
  Johns Hopkins CSSE data for cases/deaths; Google Mobility Reports for
  mobility indices; US Census Bureau for population demographics.
methods_long: >
  We implement a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered)
  compartmental model. The transmission rate varies over time as a function
  of mobility data. The model is fitted using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  (MCMC) approach to estimate parameters for the reproductive number (Rt)
  and reporting delays. Forecasts are generated by projecting the estimated
  transmission rates forward 4 weeks, assuming current mobility levels
  remain constant. Prior distributions of X and hyperparameters of Y...
